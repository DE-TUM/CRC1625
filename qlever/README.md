# Qlever docker container folder

This is the folder for the (optional) local `Qlever` docker container. It will employ this directory as its storage. 

In this case, all configuration is controlled via the `Qlever_templated.CRC1625` file, which is filled with endpoint and authentication
details from the `.env` file

No tweaks are required.
