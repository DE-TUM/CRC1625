      # If false, there should only be as many handover groups
      # Example:
      #   There is a sample with three handovers
      #     Handover 1: EDX in S
      #     Handover 2: Storage back in A01, no measurements performed
      #     Handover 3: SECCM in C01
      #   The workflow indicates a step_1 with EDX required and a step_2 with SECCM required
      # A value of 'true' will ignore the second handover and indicate that it is valid
      # A value of 'false' will try to compare step_2 with Handover 2 and fail

      # The initial step where the workflow starts.
      # The order indicated by the subsequent steps will be followed,

      # If the sample was also present in an immediately preceding step, then the validation is resumed on this step at
      # its next handover group. If it was new, then the validation will start from this step at its first handover group.

      # You can omit the previous sample IDs and change them at will, for e.g. only validating its pieces from now on
